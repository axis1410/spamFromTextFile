Formation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing
organisms. In organisms with external fertilisation, zygote is formed in
the external medium (usually water), whereas in those exhibiting internal
fertilisation, zygote is formed inside the body of the organism.
 Further development of the zygote depends on the type of life cycle
the organism has and the environment it is exposed to. In organisms
belonging to fungi and algae, zygote develops a thick wall that is resistant
to dessication and damage. It undergoes a period of rest before
germination. In organisms with haplontic life cycle (As you have read
in Class XI), zygote divides by meiosis to form haploid spores that grow
into haploid individuals. Consult your Class XI book and find out what
kind of development takes place in the zygote in organisms with diplontic
and haplo-diplontic life cycles.
Zygote is the vital link that ensures continuity of species
between organisms of one generation and the next. Every sexually
reproducing organism, including human beings begin life as a single
cellâ€“the zygote.
